# GitHub

## What it is

Source of truth for all code — Coder itself and every managed project.

Like GCP, the topology is **two layers**:

| Layer | GitHub org | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Coder itself** | [`coder-devx`](https://github.com/coder-devx) | `coder-core`, `coder-admin`, `coder-system`, future `coder-worker-*` repos. |
| **Each managed project** | its own GitHub org (e.g. `ViberTrade`) | The managed product's own repos: services, frontends, infrastructure-as-code, and the project's own `coder-system` knowledge repo. |

A **new project onboarded to Coder gets a brand new GitHub org**. No
managed project shares an org with another, and no managed project shares
an org with Coder itself. See [ADR 0009](../adrs/0009-per-managed-project-cloud-account-and-github-org.md).

## Auth model

- **GitHub App** is the planned long-term mechanism (PATs don't scale to
  per-project installation). The Coder GitHub App is installed once into
  the `coder-devx` org and again into each managed project's org.
- The app's installation token is short-lived; Coder Core mints a fresh
  one per request, scoped to the relevant installation (i.e., the
  managed project being acted on).
- Until the GitHub App is built, a PAT (`GITHUB_TOKEN` in
  `vibedevx` Secret Manager) is the fallback. Flagged in design `0004`.

## Surface used

- Repo browse: list trees, read files, search code.
- Mutations: create/update files, open PRs, open issues, review PRs.
- Workflows: trigger Actions runs, read run results.
- Org admin (System Admin role only): create new repos, set branch
  protection, configure CI secrets.

## Permissions / scopes (GitHub App)

- Per installation:
  - Repository: `contents: write`, `pull_requests: write`, `issues: write`, `actions: write`, `metadata: read`, `checks: write`
  - Organization: `members: read`, `administration: write` (System Admin only)

## Limits

- 5000 req/h per PAT; 15000 req/h per GitHub App installation. Comfortably
  under for current workload, but per-installation limits apply once we
  fan out across managed projects.

## Notes

- A new managed-project onboarding flow MUST create the GitHub org (or
  use one provided by the user), install the Coder GitHub App, and create
  the project's `{project}-coder-system` knowledge repo from the
  [`template/`](../../template/) blueprint before any worker acts on it.
- Coder's own repos NEVER live under a managed project's org, and vice
  versa. The boundary is strict.
